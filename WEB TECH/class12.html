<!-- The issue here is that the HTML specification does not allow block-level elements, like <h1>, to be placed directly inside inline-level elements, like <p>. Therefore, the browser automatically closes the <p> tag before the nested <h1> and opens a new <p> tag after it. -->
<!--  -->
    <!-- To clarify, your HTML structure is effectively interpreted as follows: -->
    <!--  -->
    <!-- html -->
    <!-- Copy code -->
    <!-- <div> -->
        <!-- <h1>this is 1st h1</h1> -->
        <!-- <h1>This is 2nd h1</h1> -->
        <p></p> Automatic closure of <p> before nested <h1>
        <!-- <h1>This is 3rd h1</h1> -->
        <p></p> Automatic opening of a new <p> after nested <h1>
    <!-- </div> -->
    <!-- This is why the third <h1> is still considered a direct child of the <div>, and the CSS selector div > h1 applies the green background to it. -->
    <!--  -->
    <!-- If you want to exclude <h1> elements inside <p> tags, you might need to reconsider your HTML structure or use JavaScript to apply styling based on specific criteria. Keep in mind that styling nested block-level elements inside inline-level elements can lead to unpredictable behavior due to how browsers interpret and adjust the HTML structure. -->
