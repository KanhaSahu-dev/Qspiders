Process is the execution of a task.
For each process separate space/memory is allocated.
For each process atleast 1 thread is there.
One thread is not dependent upon another thread.
So threads are independent.

JVM creates three important threads 
-Main
-Thread Scheduler
-Garbage Collector

JVM starts the main thread.
Thread Scheduler :- is going to Schedule a thread when it is going to execute.
It assigns thread to another thread memory if it is in sleep.

Exception occurs in the main thread not in the main method.

How can we create a Thread
By extending the Thread Class
You have to implement Runnable interface.

Thread class is present in the java.lang package.
Important methods are there:-
-setPriority()
-getPriority()
-sleep() it pauses the thread for that much miliseconds given in the argument
-join()
-start()
-run() 
-getName() returns the current thread name.
-setName() sets the current thread name.
-currentThread() returns the current/main thread's object.

When jvm created the main thread it is also stored in the jvm memory.
