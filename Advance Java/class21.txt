We need to connect java to database mainly to store the data permanently.

5 steps of JDBC
---------------

1.Load and Register the driver.
2.Establishing the Connection.
3.Create a statement or platform.(Main reason is that we need a platform to execute the sql queries.)
4.Execute the query . (This execution is also done in the platform).
5.Close the connection/route.
    ->Main reason of closing the connection is we have to close otherwise the resource leak will happen.

API provide the interfaces.

Interface
---------
Driver
Connection
Statement
ConnectionStatement
PreparedStatement
CallableStatement
ResultSet

The interfaces implement classes are given in the driver.

Helper class are the classes which has the factory methods.

1.Load and Register

Till JDK 1.4 VERSION IT IS MANDATORY TO LOAD AND REGISTER THE DRIVER because it is used to get the clarity which database it is using.

After 1.4 internally everything will be done internally.


This is done in two ways(loading and registering the driver):-
a)new keyword:-creating a object of the driver class and load it later using that.
b)forName:- 


We need to create a object of the interface Driver's object so we can create in it's implementation class present in the com.mysql.cj.jdbc , this object (Driver interface objecct) we need to pass it to the registerDriver() method.


Driver class is present in the com.mysql.cj.jdbc
create a object of the JDBC driver class.

We create a mysql jdbc driver and store in the java.sql.Driver(this is an interface) e.g.,

java.sql.Driver d = new com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver();

This d has to be passed in the method registerDriver() method.
registerDriver() method is present in the DriverManager.
