Servlet Life Cycle
------------------
These steps occur one by one in order.
1.Instantiation
---------------
Container inside the server creates an object of the servlet class.These things occurs internally.



2.Initiallisation 
-----------------
Once initialsize then only it will call 'init' method.
Initiallisation is done as when the new object is being assigned to an object reference of that servlet class.

During the Class loading process static block executes.
Similarly non static block is executed at the time of Ojbect loading.
Object loading is done first then initialisation with the constructor is done.


3.Service Phase (It is a type of main method of the servlet called)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Here it Accepts, requests,Processing, Sending

4.Destroy Phase 
---------------
The destroy() method will be called before the termination of the server not the console.
It acts like a finalize() method whatever the objects created by the Container to destroy the abandoned objects of the Servlet class.
We can also write the costly resources here.


Whenever reloading the previous objects are destoryed then again everything is started.

One time only class loading , instantiation, initialisation methods happens but service method happens many times.


***IMPORTANT***
The INIT method, SERVICE method, DESTROY method together called as "Life Cycle Methods".
