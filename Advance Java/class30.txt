Batch Processing
---------------
Executing multiple statements in one shot.
When we run queries normally it will go to the database and search the related data in the database that much number of times.This is inefficient .

To solve this problem we can store the queries in a batch then i will give the batch to the mysql workbench .It is far more efficient.This is called as batch processing.

Multiple queries will be inserted in one batch then we will execute in one go.

Batch Processing is used for DML queries.

addBatch(sql) [present in statement]
addBatch() [present in PreparedStatement]

executeBatch():- execute the batch method at a time all the rows inserted in a batch.
executeBatch() has a return type as an integer.

DTO stands for tranfering data through this object.In DTO encapsulated classes are there.

DAO stands for data access objects.(To access or for communicating to the database).(Database interaction layer) So any exception occurs in the database we can come to the DAO.

Controller is the place  where will use the datas and all. It is the main method.Input is taken here
