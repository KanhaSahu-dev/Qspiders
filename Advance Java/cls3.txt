Stream
------
Sequence of data
Input Stream                  Output Stream
FileInputStream             FileOutputStream
(Reading a file)              (Writing a file)

In FileOutputStream paranthesis mentioning true means appending another string to the same file while not replacing it.


import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
class cls3{
        File file = new File("D:\\QSPIDERS\\Advance Java\\codes\\DOREAMON");
        try{
            file.createNewFile();
            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
            String x = "hello boy";
            byte[] b = x.getBytes();
            fos.write(b);
            fos.close();
        }catch(IOException e){

        }
    }
}


Dont use throws as the remaining code will not be executed so we use the try and catch block so that remaining code will be executed.

FileOutputStream :- Write a file , if file is not there it creates and writes the file .

FileInputStream :- Read a file, if file is not there it doesnt creates.

Q) IN Encapsulation why we have to make the variables private?
