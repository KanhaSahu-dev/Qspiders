PreparedStatement is a child interface of Statement interface.

prepareStatement() From this method we can create a statement/platform.

If execute() method has a query it will not check whatever query inside the prepareStatement() query.

If it doesnt has any query then it will execute the query present in the prepareStatement.

while creating the prepareStatement the compilation is automatically done.
