Servlets
--------
Servlet is a set of rules/specifications used to build dynamic web applications.

Servlet is an API.Apis are in the form of jar files.

Here two packages are there.
1.javax.servlet
2.javax.servlet.http package

Entire servlet is based on the two packages.
Servlet is a package also.
Servlet is an interface also.
Servlet is a server side program.

Since main method is executed bcoz jvm is there .
In case of servlet we dont need the main mehtod as the java virtual machine is not needed.

API present inside the server itself.

Workflow of Servlet
--------------------
Client technically refers to the Browser not tabs.
Inside the server applications will be there and inside them resources are there.
There is no limit on how many applications I can deploy(I doubt so).
Similarly there is no limit on how many classes are there in an applications.

So in web applications we are going to use the xml configuration files.

When a user sends a request there has to be a class which is going to accept the request that request is going to be accepted by a "web.xml" configuration file on it which helps the server to decide which application it is going to send the information.

The alternative name of the web.xml file is deployment development stub.
