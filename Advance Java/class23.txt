Creating a platform/statement
------------------------------

We need a connection object without it we cant create a platform.

There are 3 ways to create a statement or platform:-
1.Statement
2.PreparedStatement
3.CallableStatement

Here we can write and execute our queries.

**getConnection returns a Connection type of object . With this I can create a platform any of the platform.

1.Statement
---------
createStatement() calling creates an internal platform will be created to execute our queries.

This createStatement is present in the Connection interface.

Once platform is created then it will return Statement type object reference.

execute() the query method is there in the Statement interface.

If we insert the values in the same primary key then DuplicateKey Exception will be thrown.
