RequestDispatcher
------------------
It is passing the resource to another class . Here passing means copy pasting the resource where the resource is available to both of the classes not just one.

RequestDispatcher not only dispatches the request it also includes the responses of other resources.Here the second response will be included in the first response then send to the client.

forward ,include method  both method are used to dispatch the request.

We have getRequestDispatcher inside the ServletRequest.

forward()
---------
When we use forward method the response of the servlet 1 response will be ignored.
Basically we are ignoring the response of the servlet1 response.

includes()
-----------
When we dispatch our request from our servlet1 class to servlet2 class the response given by the servlet2 will be included in the servlet1 response when returning to the client.

In the getRequestDispatcher we have to pass the link name same as the url pattern .

The order when we use includes method is second response then first.
