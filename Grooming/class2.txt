What is method overloading?
The process of creating multiple methods with same method name but different arguments within a class is known as method overloading.
While doing mehod overloading static and non static not required.
e.g.,
	class demo{
		public void m1(int x){}
		public void m1(double d){}
		public static void main(String...args){}
		}


What is method overriding?
Changing the implementation of parent class method in child class according to the requirement of child class is known as the process of method overriding.

Rules for performig method overriding :-
1)Minimum 2 classes are required 
2)Both the classes must have parent chlid relation.
3)Methods must be non static .

e.g.,
class parent{
	public void m1(){}
}
class child extends parent{
	public void m1(){
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}

	public static void main(String []args){}
}


We can take parent class reference to make the child class object.
We can only inherit the parent class methods not variables.
