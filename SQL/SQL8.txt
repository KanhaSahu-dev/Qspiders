MultiRow Function
==================
It is used to take multiple inputs at a time and it provides only a single output.

There are 5 types of multirow functions :-
1)MAX()
2)MIN()
3)AVG()
4)SUM()
5)COUNT()

MULTIROW FUNCTION CAN ACCEPT ATMOST ONE ARGUMENT.
Along with multirow function we cannot display any other column name in select clause.
The multirow functions ignores null values.
We cannot use multirow functions with where clause.
Count is the only multirow function which can accept star as an argument
