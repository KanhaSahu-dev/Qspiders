If we want to retrieve multiple data simultaneously then we should go for joins

There are 4 types of joins:-
1->Cartesian JOIN/CROSS JOIN
2->INNER JOIN/EQUI JOIN
3->OUTER JOIN
	LEFT OUTER JOIN
	RIGHT OUTER JOIN
	FULL OUTER JOIN
4->NATURAL JOIN 

In cross join all the records of table 1 will be merged with each and every records of table 2.

In Cross join the number of rows in the resultant table will be the product of table 1 row and table 2 row 

In cross join the number of column in the resultant table will be the summation of table 1 column and table 2 column

Inner Join OR Equi Join 

The Equi join is used to obtain only to matched records

SELECT COL_NAME FROM TAB1  INNER JOIN TAB2 ON JOIN CONDITION 

SELECT COL_NAME FROM TAB1,TAB2 WHERE JOIN CONDITION

OUTER JOIN
------------
IT IS USED TO OBTAIN THE UNMATCHED RECORDS

left outer join
-------------
If we use left outer join it can obtain unmatched records of the  LEFT table and matched records are also displayed.

SELECT COL_NAME FROM STD1 LEFT JOIN STD2 ON JOIN CONDITION;
SELECT COL_NAME  FROM STD1,STD2 WHERE JOIN CONDITION;

SQL> SELECT * FROM STD1 LEFT JOIN STD2 ON STD1.SID = STD2.SID;

       SID SNAME            SAGE PR SI
---------- ---------- ---------- -- --
         1 A                  25 M  1
         3 B                  14 M  3
         6 C                  34
SQL> SELECT * FROM STD1,STD2 WHERE STD1.SID = STD2.SID(+);

       SID SNAME            SAGE PR SI
---------- ---------- ---------- -- --
         1 B                  15 M  1
         1 A                  25 M  1
         3 B                  14 M  3
         6 C                  34

RIGHT OUTER JOIN
------------------
SELECT COL_NAME FROM STD2 LEFT JOIN STD1 ON JOIN CONDITION;
SELECT COL_NAME  FROM STD2,STD1 WHERE JOIN CONDITION;

SQL>  SELECT * FROM STD2,STD1 WHERE
  2  STD2.SID(+) = STD1.SID;

PR SI        SID SNAME            SAGE
-- -- ---------- ---------- ----------
M  1           1 B                  15
M  1           1 A                  25
M  3           3 B                  14
               6 C                  34

FULL JOIN
-----------
SELECT COL_NAME FROM STD1 FULL JOIN STD2 ON JOIN CONDITION;

Natural Join
------------
In natural join if there is any relationship between the tables then we will get the output as inner join

If there is no reln ship b/w the tables we will get the output as cross join

Q)WAQTD the first 3 characters of the name of the employees?

Q)WAQTD the last 3 characters of the employees name?
select substr(ename,length(ename)-2) from emp;

Q)WAQTD THE EMP ID OF THE EMP THOSE ARE CONTAINING ODD EMP ID?
